# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with TF-IDF and SVM

## 📚 Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline for tweets using **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier. The goal is to classify tweets into one of four categories: **Negative**, **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Irrelevant**.

The dataset consists of over **80,000 real-world tweets**, which have been preprocessed, vectorized, and used to train the model with a strong performance:

* **\~90% accuracy**
* Balanced precision, recall, and F1-score across sentiment classes.

## 🔍 Features

* **Text Cleaning**: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and tokenization.
* **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Configurable n-gram range, stop-word removal, min/max document frequency.
* **SVM Classifier**: Linear kernel, tuned hyperparameters for best generalization.
* **Custom Decoder/Encoder**: Maps numeric predictions back to human-readable sentiment labels.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Classification report, confusion matrix, and manual validation with custom tweets.

## ✅ Example Workflow

1. **Preprocess tweets**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("data/tweets.csv")
   clean_x = df["text"].str.strip().str.lower().str.replace(r"[^\w\s]", "", regex=True)
   ```

2. **Vectorize text**

   ```python
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
   vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
       ngram_range=(1, 2),
       stop_words="english",
       max_df=0.85,
       min_df=2
   )
   X = vectorizer.fit_transform(clean_x)
   ```

3. **Train SVM**

   ```python
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   model = SVC(kernel="linear", C=1.0)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Predict**

   ```python
   new_tweets = ["Feeling amazing today!", "This is so frustrating..."]
   clean_new = [t.lower() for t in new_tweets]
   X_new = vectorizer.transform(clean_new)
   preds = model.predict(X_new)
   ```

## 📈 Model Performance

| Sentiment  | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Negative   | 0.94      | 0.91   | 0.93     |
| Positive   | 0.91      | 0.86   | 0.89     |
| Neutral    | 0.89      | 0.93   | 0.91     |
| Irrelevant | 0.85      | 0.93   | 0.89     |

**Overall accuracy: \~90%**

## ⚡ Key Learnings

* TF-IDF works well for clear sentiment but struggles with subtle or sarcastic tones.
* Balanced datasets and careful preprocessing significantly impact performance.
* Custom examples show where the model excels and where it needs more robust Neutral and Irrelevant class detection.

## 🗃️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* nltk (optional, for additional text cleaning)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Future Work

* Experiment with deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for better context understanding.
* Improve sarcasm detection and subtle tone classification.
* Deploy as an API for real-time sentiment scoring.

## 🚀 Run It Yourself
